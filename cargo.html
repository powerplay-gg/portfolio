              Create a new order distribution module, because the old one is
              overloaded with functionality and is not suitable for new
              microservices.

              After talking with the product owner and the analyst, it became
              clear that the new assignment module is very similar to the old
              one, just with the functionality cut out. Previously, the entity
              that was assigned to various services was “Shipment”: it was
              possible to create many routes in it, within which you can create
              many points and add cargo by selecting the desired point of
              loading and unloading.

            <p class="pregular">
              A new entity for assignation called "Order" is a ”Shipment” who
              limited to two points, because of this I decided to make the
              process of its creation as similar as possible to the creation of
              a shipment, so that it would be easier for users to adapt to the
              new assignation center (they have been using the shipment service
              for a year already) and save the consistency of the system.

              In the process of work, I found a conflict in the work of the
              service, because in shipment it was possible to add only one cargo
              to one point, and in orders it was necessary to add a large number
              of cargoes to one order. In these statements, we contradict
              ourselves, because services are interconnected, you need to choose
              one thing: either we remove this functionality from orders, or we
              add it in shipment. I had to agree with the stakeholders on a
              meetup to discuss the conflict of business requirements. During
              the meeting, we also decided to improve the transportation
              service, because the functionality described in the cargo is
              critical for key customers. Adding a lot of loads I did through
              the grid, with adding to the grid through the sidepage.

              Before the release, presentations were made to key clients.
              Clients positively assessed the service, it was convenient and
              understandable for them to use it, noted the ease of transition
              from the transportation service and their general logic. After the
              release of the "cargo" service, users were able to use new
              services, such as automatic order routing
