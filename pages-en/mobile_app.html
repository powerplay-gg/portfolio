            Aeroclub Group is a leader in the Russian business travel market,
            developing and delivering IT solutions and services for businesses,
            and acting as an exclusive partner of the global BCD Travel network.

          <p class="regular-24 case-main-cell-right">
            As a Senior Product Designer, I was responsible for designing the
            mobile application, defining key patterns and navigation, and
            adapting the existing web product design to mobile interaction
            patterns. I worked closely with the product manager and mobile
            developer.

          <p class="h2 case-main-cell-left">Business goals</p>
          <p class="regular-24 case-main-cell-right">
            A key reason for building the app was brand positioning: all major
            players in the market already had mobile apps that provide a more
            convenient and modern customer experience. Mobile apps are typically
            faster than responsive websites, support push notifications, and can
            work offline, which is especially important in travel.
          </p>

        <div class="case-main-cell">
          <p class="h2 case-main-cell-left">Research & analysis</p>
          <div class="case-main-cell-right">
            <p class="regular-24">
              At the start of the project, I analyzed the current state of the
              product. During a large-scale redesign, mobile adaptation had been
              treated as a secondary task. It would have been odd to redesign
              without mobile support, but we did not have desktop-level
              resources. The situation was also affected by my limited mobile
              design experience at that time, so producing high-quality mobile
              interfaces immediately was difficult. While working on each travel
              service, I incrementally improved responsive layouts, which led to
              each service ending up with a slightly different mobile version.
            </p>
            <a href="img/changes.png" class="lightbox">
              <img src="img/changes.png" alt="before" class="img" />
            </a>
            <p class="regular-24">
              We also needed to rethink product navigation, since its foundation
              had been created long ago and, like the responsive design, was not
              suitable enough for a modern mobile application.
            </p>
            <p class="regular-24">
              Special attention was required for mobile-specific features that
              were missing in the current version: modern authentication,
              app-level settings (for example, notifications and biometric
              login), and more.
            </p>
            <p class="regular-24">
              In summary: we needed clear and intuitive navigation designed for
              a native mobile experience, consistent and up-to-date design
              across all services, and dedicated mobile screens (such as
              biometric authentication).
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="case-main-cell">
          <p class="h2 case-main-cell-left">Let’s build</p>
          <div class="case-main-cell-right">
            <p class="regular-24">
              After the initial navigation exploration, it became clear that the
              original solution did not work as expected. I had a familiar
              screen-transition pattern in mind, but after validating it with
              the mobile developer, we found this logic would not work in the
              app. That was when I learned more about mini-app principles and
              realized we needed to fully rethink the approach.
            </p>
            <p class="regular-24">
              After iteration, I prepared an updated navigation scheme and
              aligned it with the mobile developer. Then I presented it to the
              product manager. The adaptation took around two weeks, and we
              approved the changes.
            </p>

              <img src="img/nav-flow.png" alt="navigation flow" class="img" />
            </a>
            <p class="regular-24">
              At the final stage, we partially rebuilt the design with a focus
              on modal windows. This helped keep the app lightweight and avoid
              unnecessary complexity. As a result, the overall navigation logic
              changed as well. I redesigned the menu, transitions, and
              interactions between screens, then presented the solution to
              stakeholders. The concept was approved.
            </p>
            <a href="img/nav-updates.png" class="lightbox">
              <img src="img/nav-updates.png" alt="navigation updates" class="img" />
            </a>
            <p class="regular-24">
              Once the navigation work was complete, I moved on to redesigning
              authentication. The goal was to create a modern and intuitive
              sign-in flow for mobile: biometric access, session persistence,
              and fast re-authentication.
            </p>
            <a href="img/auth.png" class="lightbox">
              <img src="img/auth.png" alt="auth flow" class="img" />
            </a>
            <p class="regular-24">
              The final and longest phase was updating service layouts. We had
              to rebuild interfaces for the new navigation, adapt existing
              screens, and bring visual and UX quality to a single consistent
              standard.
            </p>

              <img src="img/upd_serv.png" alt="updated services" class="img" />
            </a>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="case-main-cell">
          <p class="h2 case-main-cell-left">Result</p>
          <div class="case-main-cell-right">
            <p class="regular-24">
              Unfortunately, I left the company before implementation. Before I
              departed, we had to quickly align all services to a unified mobile
              design that met current standards. This took about three weeks of
              intensive work.
            </p>
            <p class="regular-24">
              This project gave me valuable hands-on experience in mobile design
              for iOS/Android environments. I learned a lot about how mobile
              apps work under the hood and applied mobile interaction patterns
              in practice.
            </p>
            <p class="regular-24">
              Later I learned the team successfully continued the work: the
              project moved confidently toward app release and gradual migration
              from the legacy web interface to a format much closer to a native
              mobile experience.
