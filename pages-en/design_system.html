            YouDo Business is a leading Russian platform for working with
            self-employed contractors. The company provides services for
            document management, contractor operations, and tax payments,
            serving over 20,000 companies monthly. More than 3.5 billion rubles
            are paid out each month to 3.5 million contractors.

            As the only Senior Product Designer, I led design system
            development and evolution almost from scratch, including component
            creation in Figma, rollout coordination, implementation management,
            and budget alignment.

            A design system reduces design and development time, allowing teams
            to focus on higher-value tasks. It improves UI consistency,
            strengthens brand identity, and improves user experience. As product
            complexity grows, a design system also keeps design operations
            manageable and scalable.

              When I joined YouDo, my first priority was solving design-system
              related issues. The product had already moved beyond MVP and was
              growing actively, but the absence of a mature design system made
              feature delivery slower. After analyzing the current state, I
              identified several critical problems.

                no shared component base; teams used outdated components,

              <li>
                no clear component structure, making discovery and reuse

              I started by improving the component base daily. New Figma
              components were built in parallel with product feature delivery,
              because there was no dedicated design-system time allocation.
              After roughly three months, we had most elements converted into
              components, standardized the core layer, reduced the product color
              palette from 57 to 22 colors, and consolidated components,
              typography, and colors in a single structured file. This removed
              ambiguity and made the system usable.

              The next challenge was securing budget and implementation buy-in.
              With support from several engineers, I was able to demonstrate the
              need for this large-scale initiative. Because the company was in a
              difficult period, there were no immediate resources, so we moved
              implementation to later in the year and resumed in November, as
              agreed. The engineering team started implementing components and
              tokens with high motivation. I stayed closely involved, providing
              support and answering questions.

              Support from colleagues was the key factor that moved this project
              forward. In a large company with many stakeholders, you must
              navigate organizational and political constraints to deliver
              meaningful improvements.
