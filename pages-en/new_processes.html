            In May 2021, my manager left and I had to work alone. For two
            months, we could not find either a new manager or a mid-level
            designer. It became clear we could not continue like this, so I
            initiated hiring a junior designer. After hiring two juniors, I
            realized we needed to introduce new team processes.

              Previously we worked without structured tasks or sprints, and that
              was manageable for a while. After onboarding two new designers and
              increasing the number of projects, I organized the design team
              around weekly sprints with task tracking. At the start of each
              week, we synced with the Product Owner to review completed work,
              define priorities, and agree on the weekly backlog.

            <p class="regular-24">
              To improve adaptation and growth, I started weekly 1:1 meetings
              with each designer. We reviewed the past week, discussed completed
              tasks and blockers, identified growth opportunities, and defined
              the plan for the next week.

              After two years of product growth, many issues had accumulated in
              implementation quality. Given rising product complexity and
              delivery intensity, this could have led to either design quality
              decline or longer development cycles. I created a prioritized list
              of issues: inaccuracies in layouts, outdated interaction patterns,
              usability problems, and more. These were converted into tasks and
              distributed across sprints.

            <p class="regular-24">
              As the product grew, design could not scale without clearly
              documented rules. We had defined some principles with my previous
              manager, but there was no single knowledge base describing
              components and interaction patterns. Guidelines helped new team
              members ramp up faster, improved cross-team collaboration, and
              reduced the number of requests to designers. By November 2021, we
              had already presented the guideline structure and documented
              several core elements to the team.
