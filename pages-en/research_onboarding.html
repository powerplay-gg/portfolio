            We do not explain how the product and interface work. Users are
            either left on their own or forced to contact support. If we scale
            traffic to the current version, support may not handle the load.

            User autonomy can be improved in many ways: from basic UI tips to
            interactive product tours and a full help center. For MVP, we chose
            a lower-cost option: contextual in-product hints. They should be
            limited in number to avoid annoying users, but it was unclear where
            exactly users need help and what they do not understand.

            We need to place contextual hints across the interface so users can

              At project kickoff, I analyzed the current product state. During
              the global redesign, responsive behavior had been addressed as a
              residual task. Redesigning without proper mobile adaptation is
              risky, but we did not have enough resources to treat mobile with
              the same depth as desktop. The challenge was increased by my
              limited mobile-device design experience at that moment, so
              producing high-quality mobile UI immediately was difficult. Over
              time, while working on each travel service, I gradually improved
              responsive layouts, and each service ended up with its own slightly
              customized responsive version.

                Users rarely make mistakes in basic actions and generally do not
                need explanations about where controls are located. Even older
                users usually figure it out through exploration.

                The most common issues are caused by lack of UI responsiveness,
                for example when the interface does not validate errors clearly.

              It looks like detailed contextual hints are not necessary. We can
              use lightweight contextual popups with sliders that explain, at a
              high level, what happens in each part of the product. To increase
              user autonomy, we should fix error-handling issues in the
              interface.
